# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

coded a simple vanilla javascript dynamic shopping list - inspired by Mozilla's Developer JavaScript article:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents.

codes a first version of a DrumKit - inspired by Wes Bos's JavaScript 30!

**Thoughts:** I'm studying vanilla javascript and started searching for some tutorials + project's ideas. So, i found this dynamic shopping list.
I saw the picture of the demo and started coding. One thing that i tried to do was use an external javascript file, but this didn't work so i used the -script- tags, so later i will check how to do it. When i finished i compared my code with the demo. It has some differences but, in the end, it's working ok. Later i'm gonna refactor this =)

Drum Kit: i watched Wes's demo and coded before watching his solution. 
One thing that i have to improve: when pressing the key - the backgrounColor changes, the music plays THEN the background changes again.
Now, the color doesn't comes backs to initial state.
